# Module-4
Pandas Challenge

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, created a report that included the data given for the assignment. 
The assignment was to analyze data for district-wide standardized test results for schools and students. 
Access was given to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
