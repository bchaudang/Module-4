Summarizes the analysis:

Performed an analysis using the data of schools and students in High Schools based on their budget and academic scores. The data was cleaned and dataframes were categorized by district, by school, total budget, budget per student, school spending, average math and reading scores as well as percentages of students who passed math, reading and overall.

Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:

The first conclusion that can be drawn after analyzing the data given is that over test scores at Charter schools had significantly higher percentages in every category than District schools. 
The average math score was 6.6% lower, the average reading score 3% lower, the percentage of for passing math was 27% lower, for reading it was 15.8% lower and the overall passing percentage was 36.8%.
Based on these overall numbers, it's accurate to say that the level of acheivement at Charter schools is much higher. The bottom performing schools were all District schools, where the top performing schools were all Charter schools.

Another conclusion that can be made after comparing the data is that although Charter school scores were higher, District schools had a higher amount of total students. The lowest performing school had a total of 3999 students, whereas the top performing school had 1858 students, a difference of 2141 students. 
However, the budget per student at Charter schools was actually lower than the budget per student at District schools because the total school budget at District schools are higher. The spending ranges per student that were the lowest, had the highest average scores in all categories. Schools that were smaller in size showed scores that were higher than larger schools.
